An app for well being of those diagnosed with MS 

I'm a developer who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis about 3 years ago. Having gone through the disease progression for 3 years with several relapses, I think I have a first-hand understanding of life with MS. 

It made me realize that I could make some contribution and try to bring some change in the lives of those diagnosed with MS - by writing an App. 

What better way to do it than with an App, that is 

1) not written with a profit motive
2) open-source
3) avilable as a web-app (at least initially) for anyone to use

I have a fairly good idea as to what I would like to see in the App. As I progress with the App, I will be contributing it to this Git repository.

I just opened this Git repository to see if there are others interested in pitching the time to develop the app. Please ping me if this interests you.
