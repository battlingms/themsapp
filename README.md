An app for well being of those diagnosed with MS 

I'm a developer who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis about 3 years ago. Having gone through the disease progression for 3 years with several relapses, I think I have a first-hand understanding of life with MS. 

It made me realize that I could make some contribution and try to bring some change in the lives of those diagnosed with MS - by writing an App. 

What better way to do it than with an App, that is 

1) not written with a profit motive
2) open-source
3) avilable as a web-app (at least initially) for anyone to use

I have a fairly good idea as to what I would like to see in the App. As I progress with the App, I will be contributing it to this Git repository.

I just opened this Git repository to see if there are others interested in pitching the time to develop the app. Please ping me if this interests you.

In an essence, I'm thinking of the following features

Track my MS Journey - 
Date of diagnosis, 
Medication History
Date of relapses,
Drâ€™s Appointments & Reminders
Dates of Imaging 
Upload, View & Share DICOM images (HIPAA??)

Simple exercises for well being-
Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) exercise
Guess the phone number (Memory exercise)
Simple math exercises
Hand-eye coordination exercises 
Check for sensitivity with virtual tuning fork
Tongue movement exercises
Vision exercises
25 Foot walk - speed tracker

Resources -

Daily heat-index alert - Prevent an exacerbation
Daily food tracker - Could it be what I ate or how much I ate?
