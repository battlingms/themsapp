An app for well being of those diagnosed with MS 

I'm a developer who was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis about 3 years ago. Having gone through the disease progression for 3 years with several relapses, I think I have a first-hand understanding of those living with MS. It made me realize that I could make some contribution and try to bring some change in the lives of those diagnosed with MS - by writing an App. What better way to do it than with an App, that is 

1) free for those that are diagnosed with MS or those that are care-givers of MS patients 
2) open-source

I have a fairly good idea as to what I would like to see in the App. I just opened this Git project to see if there are others interested in pitching the time to develop the app.
